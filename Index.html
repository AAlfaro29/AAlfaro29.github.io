                    All about me
                </h2>
                <p>I was born in Bogota (Colombia) in 1976. My father is a civil engineer and owns an engineering 
                    company for the last 45 years.
                    I always enjoy travelling but I never have in my plans 
                    to live in another country like Australia. 
                    I finished a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering, and I arrived in 2002 to study my masters
                    in Logistics and Operations Management at the University of Wollongong. 
                    Australia became my home since then I have enjoyed every moment and opportunity that this great country has offered me.
                    I’ve got two beautiful daughters and I have lived in Peru and Saudi Arabia due my husband’s work. 
                    I have lived and travelled to beautiful places and I truly enjoy different cultures!.</p>
