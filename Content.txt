I was born in Bogota (Colombia) in 1976. My father is a Civil engineer and owns an engineering 
company for the last 45 years.
I always enjoy travelling but I never have in my plans 
to live in another country like Australia. 
I finished a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering, and I arrived in 2002 to study my masters
in Logistics and Operations Management at the University of Wollongong. 
Australia became my home since then I have enjoyed every moment and opportunity that this great country has offered me.
I’ve got two beautiful daughters and I have lived in Peru and Saudi Arabia due my husband’s work. 
I have lived and travelled to beautiful places and I truly enjoy different cultures!
